Ffs - Framework From Scratch built for research purposes. Reinventing the wheel, every functionality without using the power of Open Source

Please consider some functionalities are a little bit raw, well, let's say, ugly. It's just done for research purposes
to implement User Driven Development. 

Helping

Your help is welcome. Think on a framework, what should have, what should not, and how. There you can help me, i'd like this to be for
Frameworks what HURD is for Linux.

Todo's.
There is on index.php, or somewhere a list of todo's...But:
1. If you think for example there is not enough separacion of concerns on MVC, and M V and C are not enough decoupled, just let's talk about it. This is the first think i'd like to do.
2. The next step, is to make every functionality independent and replaceble, just like the bundles in Symfony. I'm thinking on creating just
services and configurations.
Please not overingeneriazation, what i'm searching here, is maybe, overconceptualization.
3. After step 1 and 2, what i'm planning to do, is to implement UDD.  

Instructions  - Ffs 0.1 -  


1. create database
2. import the file dbimport.sql 
3. configurate db settings in src/Ffs/Ffs/MyApp/application.conf
4. point the browser to /Public/index.php

Please take a look at /Public/index.php comment for the list of todos in order of importance.

The code have been tested just with Linux/Chrome and Linux/Firefox. 
Many thanks,
